# InsulaCRM

A self-hosted, multi-tenant real estate wholesaler CRM built with Laravel 12 and the Tabler admin template. Designed for wholesaling teams, investors, and agencies who need a dedicated tool for managing motivated seller leads, property pipelines, deal tracking, and buyer disposition.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for current state, known gaps, and what is deliberately deferred, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to contribute.

## Business Modes

InsulaCRM ships **two products in one**. The business mode is chosen during
installation and decides which modules, pipeline stages, lead statuses and team
roles the workspace uses. Modules belonging to the other mode are **hidden, not
missing** — every file is present in every release.

| | Wholesaling (default) | Real Estate Agent / Broker |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline stages | Prospecting → Dispositions → Assigned → Closing | Listing Agreement → Active Listing → Showing → Closing |
| Money field | Assignment fee | Commission |
| Property tools | ARV/MAO worksheet, distress markers, repair costs | List price, listing status, days on market |
| Modules | Disposition Room, buyer matching, list stacking | Listings, Showings, Open Houses |
| Roles | Acquisition Agent, Disposition Agent, Field Scout | Listing Agent, Buyers Agent |

If a feature from the table above is not visible in your install, you are almost
certainly in the other mode — check **Settings → General → Business Mode**.

### Changing mode after installation

The mode can be switched from **Settings → General → Business Mode**, but the
switch **does not migrate your data**. Pipeline stages and lead statuses are
stored as raw values and the two modes use different vocabularies, so records
created in the old mode keep their old stage or status until you remap them
yourself. The settings screen shows exactly how many deals and leads would be
affected before you confirm. Take a database backup first.

### The Disposition Room

The Disposition Room (wholesale mode) has no top-level navigation entry — it is
opened per deal from the deal detail page, via the **Disposition Room** button.

## Features

### Lead Management
- Full CRUD with DataTables: search, sort, and filter by source, status, temperature, and agent
- 14 pipeline statuses from New through Closed Won/Lost (customizable via Settings)
- 11 lead sources: cold call, direct mail, website, referral, driving for dollars, PPC, SEO, social media, list import, API, other (customizable via Settings)

- Inline activity editing and deletion via three-dot menu
- Task deletion and AI task suggestions with one-click add
- DNC (Do Not Contact) flag with system-wide enforcement

## Server Requirements

- **PHP** >= 8.2 with extensions: BCMath, Ctype, cURL, DOM, Fileinfo, GD, JSON, Mbstring, OpenSSL, PDO, PDO MySQL, Tokenizer, XML
- **MySQL** 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+
- **Composer** 2.x only if you plan to reinstall PHP dependencies, deploy from source, or use the development workflow
- **Apache** or **Nginx** with mod_rewrite enabled
- **Node.js** >= 18 and npm only if you plan to modify front-end assets or use the development workflow

---

## Installation

### Option A: Web Installer (Recommended)

1. Upload all files to your server in a project directory such as `/var/www/insulacrm`
2. Choose a deployment mode:
   - Recommended: point your root domain or subdomain document root to the project's `public/` directory. This is the simplest and preferred deployment path.
   - Supported for advanced users: install in a subfolder such as `/demo`, `/crm`, or `/abc`. This may require Apache or Nginx alias/rewrite configuration depending on the hosting environment.
   - Shared hosting fallback: upload into the target folder and keep the included root `index.php` and `.htaccess`, but the server must still route requests into the Laravel entrypoint correctly.
3. Create a MySQL database (e.g., `insulacrm`)
4. Ensure these directories are writable:
   ```bash
   chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
   ```
5. Visit `https://yourdomain.com/install` and follow the 5-step wizard:
   - **Step 1:** Server requirements check
     Includes PHP extensions, `.env` readiness, MySQL PDO support, writable paths, and detected install URL
   - **Step 2:** Database configuration
     Primary path: use the existing database user assigned to your app. Automatic DB-user creation is an advanced MariaDB-admin option.
   - **Step 3:** Company name and admin account setup
    - **Step 4:** Automatic migration and base data seeding
    - **Step 5:** Success - log in and start using the CRM

The packaged release already includes the production `vendor/` directory, so a standard install does not require running Composer.
It also includes the runtime dependency required for optional demo data.

Recommended deployment is via root domain or subdomain pointed to the application's `public/` directory.
Installation in a subfolder such as `/demo` or `/abc` is supported for advanced users, but may require Apache/Nginx alias or rewrite configuration depending on the hosting environment.
For subfolder installs, the final public URL should be `https://example.com/demo`, not `https://example.com/demo/public`. See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for Apache alias, Nginx, and shared-hosting examples.
The shipped root `index.php` and `.htaccess` are intended to remain safe across normal subfolder redeploys as well, so replacing the package should not require reapplying app-side rewrite tweaks.

### Option B: Manual Installation

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

If you are deploying from source or intentionally reinstalling dependencies, run:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

Edit `.env` with your database credentials, then:

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed --class=Database\\Seeders\\BaseSeeder
php artisan storage:link
```

Then create your tenant and admin user manually via Tinker or your preferred bootstrap path. The web installer normally writes the install marker automatically; standard upgrades should not require rerunning the installer or manually recreating `storage/installed.lock`.

---

## Post-Installation Setup

### Cron Job (Required)

A cron job is required for drip sequences, lead distribution auto-assignment, and due diligence countdown alerts:

```
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**
```
php C:\path\to\insulacrm\artisan schedule:run
```
Set to run every minute.

### Queue Worker (Recommended)

For background processing of email notifications, webhook delivery, buyer matching, CSV imports, and motivation score recalculation:

```bash
php artisan queue:work --daemon --tries=3 --timeout=60
```

For production, use a process manager like Supervisor to keep the worker running.

### File Storage

Deal documents are stored in `storage/app/deal_documents/`. Run the storage link command if not already done:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

### Plugins Directory

The installer creates the `plugins/` directory automatically. If installing manually, create it:

```bash
mkdir plugins
chmod 775 plugins
```

### Updates & Upgrade Path

Normal updates do **not** require reinstalling the CRM.

- The installed version is read from the root `VERSION` file
- A normal upgrade is a file-replacement and migration process, not a fresh install
- Admins can upload update ZIPs from **Settings > System**

If `storage/installed.lock` is missing but the database already contains the expected tenant and user data, the app recreates the marker automatically instead of forcing the installer again.

For the exact upgrade procedure, see [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md).

## Plugin Development

See `docs/plugin-development.md` for the full developer guide.

### Quick Start

1. Create a folder: `plugins/your-plugin/`
2. Add a `plugin.json` manifest:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Your Plugin",
     "slug": "your-plugin",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "author": "Your Name",
     "description": "What it does.",
     "min_crm_version": "1.0.0",
     "entry_class": "YourPlugin"
   }
   ```
3. Create `src/Plugin.php` extending `App\Plugins\BasePlugin`
4. Upload via Settings > Plugins or place directly in the `plugins/` directory

### Available Hooks
